# CSCI 4448 Project 2
Austin Lucas

This is the updated readme for project two. I added 3 additional java classes to the project. ZooAnnouncer, ZooFoodServer, and ZooClock. The day to day for the zoo now runs mainly on a observer pattern. ZooEmployee objects observe the zooclock in order to know when to complete their tasks. More detailed comments are included in the code.
